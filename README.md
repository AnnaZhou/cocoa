# CoCoA - Communication-Efficient Distributed Coordinate Ascent

This code performs a comparison of 4 distributed algorithms for training of machine learning models, using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org). The implemented algorithms are
 - _CoCoA_
 - mini-batch stochastic dual coordinate ascent (_mini-batch SDCA_)
 - stochastic subgradient descent with local updates (_local SGD_)
 - mini-batch stochastic subgradient descent (_mini-batch SGD_)

The present code trains a standard SVM (hinge-loss, l2-regularized), and reports training and test error, as well as the duality gap certificate if the method is primal-dual.

## Getting Started
How to run the code locally:

```
sbt/sbt assembly
./run-demo-local.sh
```

(For the `sbt` script to run, make sure you have downloaded CoCoA into a directory whose path contains no spaces.)
